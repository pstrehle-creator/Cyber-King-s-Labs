# Cyber-King-s-Labs
My name is Perry. This is my gathering space for junior cybersecurity experts trying to up their skills



What I am trying to accomplish with this repository is to share my knowledge as I continue to advance my skills as a cybersecurity expert. The threat landscape requires us to be ever adaptive and that requires us to always be refining our knowledge. This is not intended to replace comprehensive cybersecurity resources like TryHackMe or Hack the Box. It simply exists to share what I am cooking up in my home setup, and I hope it inspires you to fire up your own devices and dig into the kind of tasks employers want to see you have experience with on your resume. 

P.S. I do not actually proclaim to be the King of Cyber. It started as a nickname to make fun of me and I decided to own it. Feel free to contact me if you have issues (both "Cyber King" related and not)
